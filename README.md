# TICTACTOE
***
This project was a big one for me as a beginner. It helped me learn a lot about React, API services like Stream, and the differences between client-side and server-side code.

While the game of tic-tac-toe is simple to implement, making it work for two online users is not as easy as it seems.

Express on Node is very nice; writing GET and POST requests is easy. APIs - Stream provides you with a lot of services. The reason I used it here was the need for rendering.

## To Use
I have used vite

just set your stream API and secret in App.jsx  (client) and in index.js (server)

to run just start the server I have used some node modules 
just 

goto server and install the following
```
npm install express cors stream-chat uuid bcrypt
```
also set up nodemon

goto client and install the following
```
npm install stream-chat-react stream-chat universal-cookie
```

now to run start the server using npm run start
now start client using npm run dev
