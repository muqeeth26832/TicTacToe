# TICTACTOE

***

This project was a big one for me as a beginner. It helped me learn a lot about React, API services like Stream, and the differences between client-side and server-side code.

While the game of tic-tac-toe is simple to implement, making it work for two online users is not as easy as it seems.

Express on Node is very nice; writing GET and POST requests is easy. APIs - Stream provides you with a lot of services. The reason I used it here was the need for rendering.
